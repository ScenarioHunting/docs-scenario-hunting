# Scenario Hunting 
Scenario Hunting is a method of switching from modeling space to implementation space. It helps you to focus on what deserves your attention (the model).


Rather than ignoring all implementation details as a totally different phase from design, you selectively deal with details on the sidelines, alongside getting instant feedbacks from them. Some details are important they affect the model. The model should be adjusted as we experiment with code. Waiting for implementation phase as a general method wastes our time.

### How it works?
The process starts by visualizing an abstract scenario by clicking on some of the stickies which form the model. Then you select a test template to generate a high quality test case. The test cases sit on the middle ground and act like guardrails to keep the implementation on the track. 
You quickly derive production code from the design with total confidence. The quickness of the process enables scenario hunters to get instant feedback.
